This project is to use the google calendar API to track when I use VScode and when I am on LeetCode:
 - It's the first time I am using API's so it's going to be a little scuffed in places. Once I understand the concept more I will make my code cleaner and better to understand.
 - This is also not origional code by me and is used for some solutions I have found on google.
 - Need to use the command prompt to run the code when I use VSCode since it won't execute the else statement at the end when I close VSCode
